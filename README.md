## Design Markup

01-design-markup

Used:
- (SUIT CSS naming conventions)[https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/naming-conventions.md]
- SASS/Grunt

There are the following differences:
- fonts because I use system fonts
- image is blurry i didn't have source file
- icon

Optional things that i didn't use to keep simplicity:
- Flexbox
- Custom scrollbar because they are only supported in webkit browsers
- Img tags (including srcset attribute)
